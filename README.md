# MyPersonnalRoadmapForProgress

**Here is my repo that will show my investment.**  
At the end of each week, I should deliver a project or what I have done during that week.

Hi ! **I'm whostmdz**, i'm a french student who studying computer sciences in **BTS SIO (SLAM)**.

This repository tracks my learning journey.  
I’m making it public to stay consistent and to keep a record of my progress.

You’ll find school-related exercises here, as well as practice in the areas I enjoy most *(reverse engineering, low-level programming ...)*.

The repo will be divided into several folders according to the topics I will cover.


My goal is to go from **BTS SIO SLAM → Master** while building strong foundations in computer science.  
I focus on **low-level**, **reverse engineering**, and **pwn** to understand systems deeply.  
Everything here is done in a **strictly legal and ethical environment** (CTFs, labs, authorized targets).

## Current focus
- **C fundamentals**
- **gdb**
- **reverse methodology**
