MyPersonnalRoadmapForProgress

Here is my repo that will show my investment. At the end of each week, I should deliver a project (or share what I’ve done during that week).

Hi! I’m whostmdz — a French student studying computer science.
This repository tracks my learning journey. I’m making it public to stay consistent and to keep a record of my progress.

You’ll find school-related exercises here, as well as practice in the areas I enjoy most (reverse engineering, low-level programming...).

The repo will be divided into several folders according to the topics I will cover.
