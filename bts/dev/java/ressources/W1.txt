Abstract Class : We are using an abstract class when some objects are something in commun but are different.
Ex : A lion and an elephant are an animal, so they are in the same : class Animal.
    But can have different method so instead of recreate a class for each objects, we can juste take the parent class to have the propreties.

Implementation : We are using Implementation when we have 2 differents objects, and we want to give the capacity to do something.
Ex : A square and a circle, its 2 differents objects. We want to calculate the area of each so we can do an Implementation in the class Shape who
have the method computeArea for example. the object will have : public class Square implements Shape{}

NOTE : 
System.out.println(i.getObject) not System.out.println(i)
Mother Class : public abstract class Something() --> Child Class : public class Some extends Something()
